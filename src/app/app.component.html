  <p>Storybook is one of the best open-source Angular projects that allows teams to make UI (user interface) components for React.js, Vue, and Angular. Furthermore, support for React Native, a cross-platform framework, has been added recently.

    This development environment runs outside of the application, which enables specialists to easily reuse various components. Employing this tool, you donâ€™t have to worry about software-specific dependencies. As a consequence, you significantly reduce the time for creating and testing a digital product.</p>
